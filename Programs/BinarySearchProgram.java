 * Q1.Search insert position of K in a sorted array';?
 * 
 * Given a sorted array arr[] consisting of N distinct integers
 * and an integer K, the task is to find the index of K,
 * if itâ€™s present in the array arr[].
 * Otherwise, find the index where K must be inserted to keep the array sorted.
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 6}, K = 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Since 5 is found at index 2 as arr[2] = 5, the output is 2.
 * 
 * Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 6}, K = 2
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: Since 2 is not present in the array but can be inserted at index
 * 1 to make the array sorted.
 * 
 * as the given array is shorted we have to first think about applying Binary
 * Search
 * So tha we cah have O(log n) as time complexity
